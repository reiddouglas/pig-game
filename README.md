# pig-game

This a 2-player game made using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with DOM manipulation and Javascript fundamentals.

## Overview

Two players take turns rolling a die. Each time a player rolls the die (it is rolled automatically when it becomes their turn), their score for that turn is increased by the amount they rolled. After each roll, the current player can choose to **roll again**, or to **hold onto their score**. If they choose to hold onto their score, their score for the turn is added to their **total score** and their turn ends. If they chooses to roll again, the player gets to roll again. The process of rolling again continues until the player chooses to hold their score, or until they roll a one. If a one is rolled, the player **loses their score for that turn** and their turn ends.
The **goal** is to get to a total score of 100 by strategically choosing when to hold and when to roll.
